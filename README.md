**When your Mac renders black frames, you learn to distribute.**

I wanted Claude to generate images through my local ComfyUI setup. Ran Sonic. Ten seconds of pure black frames. The GPU couldn't keep up.

So I distributed it.

The MCP server runs on Fly.io—stateless, auto-scaling. GPU compute lives on RunPod, pay-per-second. Generated assets go to Supabase with signed URLs. Tailscale meshes it all together securely. What started as "let me generate some images" became a production distributed system because the alternative was a space heater that outputs nothing.

Now Claude can generate images, upscale them, run ControlNet pipelines, synthesize speech, and create lip-synced talking head videos—all through natural conversation. **35+ tools. 467 tests. No API fees. Full parameter control.**

```
You: "Generate a cyberpunk cityscape at sunset and save it to ./assets/hero.png"

Claude: I'll generate that image for you.
        [Calls generate_image with prompt, saves to ./assets/hero.png]
        Done! The cyberpunk cityscape has been saved to ./assets/hero.png
```

- Node.js 18+
- At least one Stable Diffusion checkpoint model

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/comfyui-mcp.git
cd comfyui-mcp
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Claude Code

Add to `~/.claude/settings.json` (global) or `.claude/settings.local.json` (project-specific):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "comfyui": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "tsx", "/absolute/path/to/comfyui-mcp/src/index.ts"],
      "env": {
        "COMFYUI_URL": "http://localhost:8188",
        "COMFYUI_MODEL": "dreamshaper_8.safetensors"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note**: Replace `/absolute/path/to/comfyui-mcp` with the actual path where you cloned this repo.

### 3. Start ComfyUI

Ensure ComfyUI is running at the configured URL (default: http://localhost:8188).

### 4. Restart Claude Code

**Important**: Claude Code loads MCP servers at startup. You must restart Claude Code (exit and relaunch) after adding the configuration.

### 5. Generate Images

Start generating:

```
"Generate a portrait with warm lighting and save it to ./images/portrait.png"
```

## Architecture

```
┌─────────────┐     MCP Protocol    ┌─────────────┐     REST/WS     ┌──────────┐
│   Claude    │ ◄─────────────────► │  MCP Server │ ◄─────────────► │ ComfyUI  │
│   (Client)  │    Tool Calls       │  (Bridge)   │   Workflows     │  (API)   │
└─────────────┘                     └─────────────┘                 └──────────┘
```

The MCP server:
1. Exposes tools to the AI client
2. Receives requests with parameters
3. Builds ComfyUI workflow JSON
4. Queues workflows via REST API
5. Monitors progress via WebSocket
6. Retrieves and saves generated images

### How ComfyUI Workflows Work

ComfyUI represents image generation as a graph of nodes. Each node performs an operation:

```
CheckpointLoader → CLIPTextEncode → KSampler → VAEDecode → SaveImage
       ↓                                ↑
    LoraLoader(s) ──────────────────────┘
```

Our server dynamically constructs these graphs based on your parameters. When you specify LoRAs, we inject LoraLoader nodes into the chain. The workflow is submitted as JSON to ComfyUI's `/prompt` endpoint.

### Why This Architecture

Some decisions here didn't come from the AI—they came from knowing what breaks at scale:

- **Distributed rate limiting (Upstash Redis)**: In-memory rate limiters fail when you have multiple Fly.io instances. Sliding window algorithm, tier-based limits, per-API-key with IP fallback.
- **Quirrel for long-running jobs**: Fly.io has connection limits (25 hard, 20 soft). Portrait generation, TTS, and lipsync run async through job queues. Otherwise HTTP timeouts kill requests.
- **Storage abstraction layer**: Single interface, three implementations (Supabase, GCP, local). Swap providers with an env var. No vendor lock-in.
- **Tailscale mesh**: RunPod URLs are public. Tailscale adds a security layer between Fly.io and the GPU node.
- **Strategy pattern for prompting**: Illustrious wants tags, Flux wants natural language, Pony needs score tags. Six model families, six strategies, auto-detected from checkpoint name. The alternative was unmaintainable spaghetti.

The AI suggested "use Playwright locally" for browser automation. That's not remotely plausible in a distributed context. Knowing *when* to distribute matters.

## Troubleshooting

### Tools not showing in Claude Code
1. Ensure you've restarted Claude Code after adding the MCP configuration
2. Check that the path to `src/index.ts` is absolute and correct
3. Verify the server starts manually: `npx tsx /path/to/src/index.ts` (should print "ComfyUI MCP server running on stdio")
4. Try killing all Claude Code instances and restarting fresh

### "Connection refused"
Ensure ComfyUI is running at the configured COMFYUI_URL.

### "Model not found"
Run `list_models` to see available checkpoints. Model names must match exactly, including file extension.

### "No image in output"
Check ComfyUI's web interface for workflow errors. The queued prompt may have failed due to missing nodes or invalid parameters.

### Slow generation
Generation time depends on hardware, model size, and step count. Reduce steps for faster drafts.

### LoRA not applying
Verify the LoRA filename with `list_loras`. Ensure strength values are reasonable (0.5-1.2 typically).

## Extending

The codebase is designed for extension:

- **ControlNet**: Add conditioning workflows in `src/workflows/` and corresponding tools
- **Inpainting**: Extend img2img with mask support
- **Video**: ComfyUI supports AnimateDiff—same workflow pattern applies
- **Custom nodes**: Any ComfyUI custom node can be integrated into workflow templates

### How It Works

1. **Client Request**: Claude Code (via MCP) or web apps (via HTTP) send generation requests
2. **Service Processing**: The service builds ComfyUI workflows and queues them
3. **GPU Execution**: RunPod executes the workflow on a rented GPU (RTX 4090)
4. **Cloud Storage**: Results are uploaded to Supabase Storage
5. **Signed URLs**: A 1-hour signed URL is returned for secure browser viewing

### RunPod Setup

Don't have a local GPU? Run ComfyUI on RunPod and connect remotely.

1. Create a RunPod pod with PyTorch template
2. SSH in and run:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_REPO/main/deploy/quick-deploy.sh | bash -s -- --dreamshaper
```
3. Get your pod URL: `https://<POD_ID>-8188.proxy.runpod.net`
4. Configure locally:
```bash
./deploy/scripts/configure-local.sh https://<POD_ID>-8188.proxy.runpod.net
```

See [deploy/README.md](./deploy/README.md) for detailed instructions.

### Cloud Storage (Supabase)

Generated images can be automatically uploaded to Supabase Storage with signed URLs for secure sharing.

**Setup:**
1. Create a Supabase project
2. Create a storage bucket named `generated-assets`
3. Add the RLS policy: `true` (or `auth.role() = 'service_role'` for restricted access)
4. Set environment variables (see below)

**Usage:**
- MCP tools (`imagine`, `generate_image`) include `upload_to_cloud: true` by default
- Results include a `remote_url` field with a 1-hour signed URL
- URLs can be opened directly in browsers for viewing

### HTTP Server (Web Integration)

For web apps that can't use MCP directly, an HTTP server is available:

```bash
# Start the HTTP server
npm run serve
# or
node dist/http-server.js
```

**Endpoints:**

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/health` | GET | Health check with GPU info |
| `/imagine` | POST | Natural language image generation |
| `/image` | POST | Direct txt2img generation |
| `/portrait` | POST | AI portrait generation |
| `/tts` | POST | Text-to-speech with F5-TTS |
| `/lipsync` | POST | Video lip-sync with MuseTalk |

**Example:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-service.fly.dev/imagine \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "description": "A cyberpunk cityscape at sunset",
    "output_path": "/tmp/cyberpunk.png"
  }'

# Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "imagePath": "/tmp/cyberpunk.png",
  "signedUrl": "https://xxx.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/sign/...",
  "seed": 1234567890,
  "message": "✨ Image generated successfully!"
}
```

### Fly.io Deployment

Deploy the HTTP server to Fly.io for production web integration:

```bash
# Install flyctl
curl -L https://fly.io/install.sh | sh

# Deploy
fly launch
fly secrets set \
  COMFYUI_URL="https://<POD_ID>-8188.proxy.runpod.net" \
  COMFYUI_MODEL="novaFurryXL.safetensors" \
  SUPABASE_URL="https://xxx.supabase.co" \
  SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY="sb_secret_xxx" \
  SUPABASE_BUCKET="generated-assets" \
  STORAGE_PROVIDER="supabase"

fly deploy
```
